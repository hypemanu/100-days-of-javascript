The most basic syntax of javascript is defining a Javascript file.

Javascript files have a .js extension.


Examples:

newjavascript.js
helloworld.js
mycode.js

If you wish to internally code javascript into a HTML file, use the SCRIPT tags:


<script>

</script>



Javascript comments have 2 forward slashesbefore them.

//This is a comment
//This is another comment.


The comments can also span multiple lines, but have one forward slash, followed by an asterisk,
then closed with an asterisk then a backslash..

/* This comment is the first line
second line
third line
last line */
